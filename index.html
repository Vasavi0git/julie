    <h3><p>When it comes to a pet's health checkup, it's important to follow a routine to ensure your furry friend stays healthy. During a checkup, the veterinarian typically examines your pet's overall health, including weight, temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate. They may also check for any signs of illness or abnormalities.

        The vet may also conduct tests like blood work, urine analysis, and parasite screenings to assess your pet's internal health. Dental health is often checked too, as dental issues can impact your pet's overall well-being.

It's always a good idea to follow your vet's recommendations for vaccinations, preventative care, and nutrition tailored to your pet's specific needs. üêæü©∫</p></h3>
